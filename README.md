As part of my internship at Prodigy, I completed a series of data science and machine learning tasks designed to strengthen my analytical, visualization, and predictive modeling skills. Each task in this repository focuses on a unique aspect of data analysis, ranging from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building classifiers and performing sentiment analysis. Through these tasks, I gained hands-on experience working with diverse datasets, implementing machine learning models, and deriving actionable insights from real-world data. This repository showcases my work on these tasks, demonstrating my approach to problem-solving in data-driven projects.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Distribution Visualization

Objective: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender in a population dataset.
Key Highlights: Uses data visualization techniques to represent data distributions. Provides insights into variable frequencies and distributions.
Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, to explore variable relationships and identify data patterns and trends.
Key Highlights: Includes data preprocessing steps, handling missing values, and visualizing variable relationships to gain insights into dataset structure and trends.
Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

Objective: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data. Uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Key Highlights: Implements a supervised learning model to classify purchase likelihood, featuring data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
Task 4: Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

Objective: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinions and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.
Key Highlights: Employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis and data visualization to highlight public opinion trends.
Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Objective: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
Key Highlights: Utilizes data analysis and geospatial visualization techniques to identify accident-prone areas and factors influencing traffic incidents.
